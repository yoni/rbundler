Title: Rbundler manages an application's dependencies systematically
    and repeatedly.
Description: Rbundler manages a project-specific library for dependency
    package installation. By specifying dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file
    in a project's root directory, one may install and use dependencies
    in a repeatable fashion without requiring manual maintenance.
    rbundler creates a project-specific R library in
    `PROJECT_ROOT/.Rbundle` (by default) and a project-specific
    `R_LIBS_USER` value, set in `PROJECT_ROOT/.Renviron`. It supports
    dependency management for R standard "Depends", "Imports",
    "Suggests", and "LinkingTo" package dependencies. rbundler also
    attempts to validate and install versioned dependencies, such
    as ">=", "==", "<=". Note that, due to the way R manages package
    installation, differing nested versioned dependencies are not
    allowed. For example, if your project depends on packages A (== 1),
    and B (== 2), but package A depends on B (== 1), then a nested
    dependency violation will cause rbundler to error out.
Depends:
    R (>= 2.15.1),
    devtools (>= 1.3)
Suggests:
    testthat (>= 0.8),
    roxygen2
